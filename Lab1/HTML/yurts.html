            <strong><dt>What is a yurt?</dt></strong>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities arc located in the lodge.

            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
